My team was manually checking the phone numbers on the prospective customers lists to see if they were portable, so that we only reach out to prospects with portable phone numbers. This drastically increased our conversion rates to avoid wasting time by reaching out and spending time trying to sell to prospects who in the end wouldn't be able to port their phone numbers to us. 

We had a portal that allowed 1,000 to be checked at a time, but it would take several minutes for that many. And the lists we were getting every couple of weeks could contain up to 100,000 prospects. 

On top of that I would scrubbing off prospects for anything from being a duplicate to already in the system to have invalid information. 

I discovered a book called Automate The Boring Stuff, while teaching myself basic Python for data analytics purposes. I realized this was a perfect opportunity to automate something. 

This script automated the scrubbing process of those lists. And it uses API calls to append phone service provider and portability of phone number, identifying even more items that can be scrubbed from the list. 

It works for any amount of prospects (rows in CSV)
